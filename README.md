## About the Project

*Life's Progress (LP)* is a systemic 2D platformer where players explore an intricately simulated living ecosystem. Inspired by the complexity of real-world ecological systems, *LP* emphasizes environmental interactions, population dynamics, and organic world-building without human intervention. Players will witness the rise and fall of species, the balance between organisms, and the subtle interdependencies that drive the progression of life in a dynamic world.

## Features

- **Realistic Ecosystem Simulation**: An immersive environment that evolves based on population dynamics, climate factors, and terrain deformations.
- **Open-World Exploration**: Traverse a vast 2D world filled with flora, fauna, and dynamic terrains, all interacting naturally.
- **Educational Gameplay**: Gain insights into how ecosystems work while enjoying engaging, emergent gameplay.

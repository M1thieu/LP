A systemic 2D platformer where life emerges from fundamental physics within a dynamic ecosystem.

---

## About the Project

*Life's Progress (LP)* is a systemic 2D platformer where players explore an intricately simulated living ecosystem. Unlike traditional games, LP builds life and environments from first principles - atoms form molecules, molecules form cells, and cells evolve into organisms. The world evolves dynamically through physics and chemistry, without direct player intervention shaping its development.

Players will witness the rise and fall of species, the balance between organisms, and the subtle interdependencies that drive the progression of life in a dynamic world. Rather than controlling the world, players experience it from within, potentially inhabiting different creatures to explore survival from various perspectives.

## Core Philosophy

LP is built on several foundational principles that set it apart:

- **True Emergence**: Life and behaviors arise naturally from basic physical and chemical systems rather than being scripted
- **Unified Simulation**: All systems (physics, chemistry, biology, ecology) interact within a single coherent framework
- **Perspective-Based Experience**: Players experience the world from within, rather than playing as omnipotent manipulators
- **Persistent Consequences**: Actions have lasting impacts on a world that evolves organically over time
- **Scientific Authenticity**: Based on real principles of biology, ecology, and physics, simplified only where necessary

## Features

- **Realistic Ecosystem Simulation**: An immersive environment that evolves based on population dynamics, climate factors, and terrain deformations.
- **Open-World Exploration**: Traverse a vast 2D world filled with flora, fauna, and dynamic terrains, all interacting naturally.
- **Educational Gameplay**: Gain insights into how ecosystems work while enjoying engaging, emergent gameplay.
- **Bottom-Up Dynamics**: Matter and energy systems that build organically from fundamental forces to complex organisms.
- **Multi-Scale Experience**: Explore life from microscopic to macroscopic levels, each with unique survival challenges.
